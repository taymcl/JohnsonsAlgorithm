Final project for CS253 class. Johnson's Algorithm uses Djikstra's Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm to compute the shortest path between "planets"
User must input number of planets and the weighted matrix of known distances between planets 
Output will be shortest known distance between every planet combination
